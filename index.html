      <h2 class="mb-3">Which quantum mechanics interpretation suits me?</h2>
      <p class="lead">Quantum mechanics is weird, to say the least. It gives us a mathematical framework for predicting observations and such, as a body
        of scientific laws should. But people continue to disagree as to what do its elements actually mean. This test aims to find the interpretation that
      suits you the most, based on their characteristics.</p>

          <h4>Determinism</h4>
          <p class="mb-3">Determinism, in this context, is the concept that events are bound by causality in such a way that any state
          (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. </p>

          <h4>Is the wavefunction real?</h4>
          <p class="mb-3">The wavefunction is a mathematical description of the state of an isolated system: a complex-valued probability amplitude. 
          But does it represent something that actually exists? Does it represent something physical? </p>
          <div class="row mb-4 align-items-center">

          </div>

          <h4>Is there a unique history?</h4>
          <p class="mb-3">Quantum mechanics often deals with multiple results for experiments: calculations give out the probabilities of different outcomes.
          One of them ends up being what we actually observe, but what of the other "histories"? Do they happen in some way?</p>
          <div class="row mb-4 align-items-center">
            <div class="col-md-4 offset-md-1 text-right">There <span class="font-weight-bold">shouldn't</span> be a unique history</div>

          </div>


          <h4>Collapse of the wavefunction</h4>
          <p class="mb-3">When a system is in a state of superposition of "base states" (eigenstates), it appears to reduce to one of these 
            (by "observation"). But is this a real phenomenon, or is it just a secondary phenomenon? For example, it could be that what we observe as the 
          "collapse" is just the system entering a superposition with its environment, transferring information to it.</p>
          <div class="row mb-4 align-items-center">
            <div class="col-md-4 offset-md-1 text-right">There should be <span class="font-weight-bold">no such thing</span> as the wavefunction's collapse</div>

          </div>

          <h4>Observer role</h4>
          <p class="mb-3">For quantum mechanics, an observer corresponds to the act of measurement, which results in the system taking on specific values.
          But does this mean quantum mechanics is describing something about the observer or its interactions with the system?</p>
          <div class="row mb-4 align-items-center">
            <div class="col-md-4 offset-md-1 text-right">The observer <span class="font-weight-bold">should not</span> have a special role in the interpretation</div>

          </div>

          <h4>Hidden variables</h4>
          <p class="mb-3">Some people argue that quantum mechanics is incomplete: there could be "hidden variables" that could account, for example, for the 
            indeterminacy in measurements. Knowledge of these hidden variables would result, then, in a theory without indeterminacy. However, it must be noted
          that hidden variables are incompatible with local dynamics (see below)</p>
          <div class="row mb-4 align-items-center">
            <div class="col-md-4 offset-md-1 text-right">There <span class="font-weight-bold">shouldn't</span> be any hidden variables</div>
            <div class="col-md-2 text-center">

          </div>

          <h4>Local dynamics</h4>
          <p class="mb-3">The principle of locality states that an object is directly influenced only by its immediate surroundings. A theory which includes the principle of locality is said to be a "local theory". Note that locality rules out the possibility of hidden variables (see above).</p>

          </div>

          <h4>Counterfactual definiteness</h4>
          <p class="mb-3">Counterfactual definiteness is the ability to speak "meaningfully" of the definiteness of the results of measurements that have not
            been performed. In other words, an interpretation with counterfactual definiteness treats unmeasured results on an equal footing with measured 
          results in statistical calculations.</p>

          <h4>Universal wavefunction</h4>
          <p class="mb-3">The universal wave function is the wavefunction or quantum state of the totality of existence, regarded as the "basic physical entity"
          or "the fundamental entity, obeying at all times a deterministic wave equation.</p>

Therefore, this interpretation does not allow for something thing like \"the wavefunction of an individual system\".

According to this interpretation, physical system doesn't have definite properties before being measured: wave and particle properties depend on the experimental arrangement. Furthermore, quantum mechanics is about observations and measurements, the wavefunction's collapse is an actual phenomenon under this interpretation, and the act of observation causes this collapse (according to probabilities given by the wavefunction), giving the observer a causal role. No hidden variables are allowed, so physics are non-local, in addition to being non-deterministic. This interpretation has difficulties with describing the \"laboratory\" where results are measured, typically using classical physics for it.",

This interpretation postulates that the system has a well-defined configuration when unobserved, and probabilities are a practical necessity for solving the guiding wave problem, and not as an inherent lack of complete determination in the properties of matter, doing away with measurement problems. This results in a very \"classical-like\" interpretation: it is deterministic, single-history and has counterfactual definiteness. However, it is a non-local interpretation (as the pilot wave depends on its boundary conditions, which might reach across the universe) and it requires hidden variables (the actual positions of particles are hidden).",

It is very similar to the ensemble interpretation in that it talks about a set of similarly-prepared systems instead of a single system. Therefore it is an interpretation that rejects the wavefunction's collapse as a phenomenon, the role of the observer and counterfactual definiteness. Furthermore, the nonexistence of hidden variables is actually fundamental to quantum logic, and Bell's lemmas can be reproduced using it. However, as it is more about reasoning than a physical interpretation, it is agnostic with respect to many issues, such as determinism, the physical existence of the wavefunction, the observer role and whether dynamics are local.",

For example, a source creates a forwards-evolving quantum state for photons that are tested by a detector. This interpretation posits that there are backwards-evolving quantum states for these photons, created by the detector and tested by the source. These backwards-evolving states exist at present time, and are constructed in such a way that measurement results are well-defined. This interpretation results in a deterministic theory with local dynamics. This interpretation also removes the collapse phenomenon and the observer's role in it; it does require hidden variables, though."

Variants of this interpretation differ in whether these other universes really exist or are an abstract construct and if these universes existed before the split, but they do away with the collapse phenomenon. The observer gets no special role, no hidden variables are needed, and dynamics are local, but the idea of a unique history is abandoned.",

    description: "This interpretation argues that the subjective perception of the human observer is what causes the wavefunction's collapse. The human (and possibly animal) minds act as external observers that cannot be treated within quantum mechanics. The wavefunction, then, is a real object with which these minds interact, putting the oserver in a central role. There is, in addition, a universal wavefunction, a unique, non deterministic history.",

    description: "This interpretation posits that spacetime fluctuations are the cause of quantum mechanics, not one of its consequences. The first of these theories understood the Schrödinger equation as a diffusion equation for a Markov process. In this interpretation, it's not possible to define velocities for particles, as their paths are not smooth. The Markov process is hidden, but if it was known (plus initial conditions), the theory results in a realistic interpretation, with results existing before they are measured. Dynamics, however, are non-local.",

    description: "This interpretation is similar to the many-worlds interpretation in that it rejects the notion of a unique history, it involves a universal wavefunction, and there is a branching phenomenon instead of the wavefunction's collapse. However, instead of branching universes, this interpretation involves branching consciousnesses. Every sentient being is attributed with an infinity of minds, whose prevalence correspond to the amplitude of the wavefunction. As an observer checks a measurement, the probability of realizing a specific measurement directly correlates to the number of minds they have where they see that measurement. It is in this way that the probabilistic nature of quantum measurements is obtained.",

    description: "According to this interpretation, the wavefunction is only a tool for calculating probabilities. The development of the quantum system is a stochastic process; there exist bundles of consistent histories, called frameworks, which are equally real. Any discussion of a quantum system must be confined to a single framework, ruling out paradoxes. Measurements reveal existing properties of quantum objects; however, a property that exists in some frameworks may not exist in others.",

    description: "Under this interpretation, the wavefunction is composed of a component that is retarded wave that moves forward in time, and an advanced wave that moves backward in time. A quantum event occurs when a \"handshake\" exchange of advanced and retarded waves triggers the formation of a transaction in which energy, momentum, angular momentum, etc. are transferred: this handshake is the wavefunction's collapse. This interpretation is explicitly non-local, and sees the wavefunction as a real object. A particularity of this interpretation is that it uses solutions admitted by the relativistic Schrödinger equation, as the ordinary one does nod admit advanced waves.",

    description: "These theories center around the idea that the wavefunction is a real entity, and its collapse is an actual phenomenon, caused at random or when reaching some physical threshold. This often means introducing small amounts of non-linearity into the equations.  However, the collapse is not complete in some of these theories, which might mean there is a non-zero mass density in unobserved states. This interpretation has no hidden variables, does not have locality, and assigns no special role to the observer.",

    description: "This interpretation states that quantum mechanics is not an absolute description of reality, but rather deals with relations between various objects. Therefore, an observer-independent description is unphysical: different observers may give different descriptions of the same event if they have a hierarchical relation. This interpretation gives an intrinsic role to observers, rejects hidden variables and treats measurement as an ordinary physical interaction, but it is not clear with respect to determinism. There are claims that this interpretation allows to avoid some conflicts between quantum mechanics and special relativity (such as de Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox).",

For example, in this interpretation, a quantum state is not an element of reality—instead it represents the degrees of belief an agent has about the possible outcomes of measurements. Quantum measurement outcomes, then, are personal experiences for the agent gambling on them. This, of course, gives the observer a central role in the theory, sees the wavefunction's collapse as a real phenomenon that represents a change in the agent's beliefs. In addition to this, QBism claims to eliminate nonlocality.",
